Snake Squad
=================

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

In order to use the Snapchat login and bitmoji functionality on index.html, your Snap username will need to be added 
to the project on SnapKit. 

In order to play the game: you are a snake that you can control with your arrow keys. 
The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as you can without accidentally eating yourself. 


Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what this project does and how to read it.

### ← index.html and index-login.js 

These two files are responsible for the home page of the game, including the log in via Snapchat's Login Kit. 

### ← game.html, game.css, and game.js

These are responsible for running the snake squad game. game.html relies on game.css for styling and game.js for interactivity. 
Most of your work will be in modifying game.js. 

### ← assets

You can drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
